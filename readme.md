## Inspiration for project

It has been observed that patients are confused while searching for the best doctors for their treatment. This application will show a list of best doctors in your vicinity where in patients can book their appointments with doctors and simultaneously as the patient will book the appointment, a patient queue will be displayed at the doctor’s end.

the patient’s portal, he/she can enter the symptoms and will able to know their possible diseases. **This application is based on a ML model {decision tree}** which works on a huge database collected by our team in order to predict this possible disease.

At the same instance these symptoms entered by the patient will be displayed at the doctor end wherein after looking at patient symptoms, Doctor can start a video consultation **through our inbuilt video calling feature.** for quick & hassle free consultation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


## Further Development
1. we will implement a ML model wherein the doctors will be assisted in prescribing the medicine

2. we have also planned to develop a data mining model wherein the treatment will be compared with worldwide doctors to showcase the authenticity and validity of treatment in percentage and the same comparison graph will be displayed at patient portal it will make the patient feel satisfied with the treatment.

3. it is planned to integrate this portal with online payment apps {GPAY, Paytm, etc...}
